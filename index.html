             <p> My name is Jake. I live in Philadelphia. I joined a coding boot camp to develop the skillset that will allow me to work in the software development field. I previously worked in real estate mgmt in the affordable housing market for the past eight years before deciding to change course. In my free time, I like powerlifting and electric skateboarding.</p>
