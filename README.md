# <Professional Portfolio - J. Duncan>

## Description

In this project, we created a working portfolio page from scratch that we will add to as the course progresses. The page includes our contact information and a display of our work to date. We included media queries to allow a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports. 

During this project, I continued to learn about basic HTML and CSS functions, utilizing the flex property for page layout and setting media queries.
